Project Description

Structure two microservices, one named account the other one named vehicle



functionality should be only accounts getting vehicles assigned to them and vehicle ownerships getting transferred
so basically once a vehicle ownership is transferred, account should be updated and once an account is getting a new vehicle, vehicle should be updated

your focus should be on the way you structure your code and your micro services talking to each other

aim is to demonstrate best practices and design patterns you can use to implement them
